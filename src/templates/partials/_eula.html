      { text: '<span class="terms__point">(a)</span> <span class="terms__underline">Equitable Remedies.</span> Customer acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach by Customer of any of the agreements or other or provisions contained in this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing harm to BTB for which the BTB would not have adequate remedy at law.  Therefore Customer acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, in addition to any other remedy which BTB may have at law or in equity, the BTB shall be entitled to such injunctive relief or other equitable remedies to restrain Customer from violating the provisions of this Agreement and Customer hereby consents to the granting of such injunctive relief or other equitable remedy by any court of competent jurisdiction, without BTB having to prove the inadequacy of the available remedies at law or any actual damages (and without being required to post a bond or other security).  Any such remedy sought or obtained shall not be considered either exclusive or a waiver of the rights of BTB  to assert a claim for any other remedies it may have at law or in equity.' },
      { text: '<span class="terms__point">(b)</span> <span class="terms__underline">Severability and Waiver.</span> If any term or provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms and provisions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term or provision. The waiver by BTB SOFT of any default or breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach.' },
      { text: '<span class="terms__point">(c)</span> <span class="terms__underline">Governing Law.</span> This Master Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without reference to the principles of conflicts of law.  Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, sitting in New York County, and the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York.  Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and the right to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such party.  In any such suit, action or proceeding, each party waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, personal service of any summons, complaint or other process and agrees that the service thereof may be made by certified or registered mail, addressed to such party at its address as set forth in the preamble hereinabove.  Each party further waives, to the full extent provided by law, any right to be a class or other representative or other plaintiff or claimant in any collective or class action, and agrees that it shall not bring, join in or otherwise participate in any class action against the other.' },
